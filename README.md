# Cedar Nexus Project

The **Cedar Nexus** project is a personal research and development initiative that combines two key areas of focus: **nutrient prediction** and **nutrient interactions**. Its primary goal is to advance the understanding of how nutrients interact with each other and how this knowledge can be used to optimize nutrition for healthier, more sustainable food systems.


## Project Overview

Cedar Nexus seeks to map and optimize the interactions between nutrients through exploring **machine learning** and **biochemistry**. The project is divided into two main subprojects:

- **Nutrideep**: A series of deep learning models designed to predict missing nutrients in food items based on known data (e.g., calories, protein, fat, sugar content). By leveraging machine learning, Nutrideep generates more complete nutritional profiles, including vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.

- **Nutrimerge**: This research investigates the **dynamic interactions** between different nutrients, exploring how they affect absorption and overall health. Traditional nutritional models often ignore these interactions, but Cedar Nexus seeks to incorporate them, developing more holistic models of nutrition.


## Nutrideep: Predict Missing Nutrients

**Nutrideep** is a machine learning-based tool that predicts missing nutritional information for food items. Given the nutritional content of a food item (e.g., energy, protein, fat, sugar), the models can predict the levels of missing nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.

### How It Works

- **Input**: Nutrient data (e.g., calories, protein, fat, sugar, salt) from food packaging or other sources.
- **Prediction**: The machine learning model predicts missing nutrient values, such as specific vitamins or amino acids.
- **Output**: A fuller, more accurate nutritional profile of the food item, including the predicted values.

### Performance

The models have been shown to have a surprisingly high accuracy, with **RÂ² values** of around **0.97** for predicting amino acid content. While there is still room for improvement, the models can predict nutrient values for a wide variety of foods, making it a valuable tool for both food consumers and health professionals.


## Nutrimerge: Understanding Dynamic Nutrient Interactions

The **Nutrimerge** subproject focuses on the complex, dynamic relationships between nutrients. Unlike traditional models that treat nutrients in isolation, this project aims to account for how dietary fibers, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients interact with each other during digestion and absorption.

### Approach

Instead of simply adding up the nutrients in a food item, Iâ€™ve designed a **serial calculation system**, where each nutrient interaction is modeled **step-by-step**, with each function building on the previous one. This approach tries to simulate the complexity of how nutrients might interact, based on existing studies and research.


## How to Contribute

Since this is a personal project, Iâ€™m still learning and refining my understanding of nutrition and machine learning. Iâ€™m **open to collaboration** and suggestions as I continue to develop these ideas.
